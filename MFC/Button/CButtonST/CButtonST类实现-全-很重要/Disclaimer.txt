Terms of use
------------
In the past years SoftechSoftware has produced many free controls and code snippets.
All of this products were released with the full source codes included and hundreds of developers
all around the world have taken benefits using these easy and ready to use controls into their applications.
In return, SoftechSoftware asked only for a small money donation from developers. Unfortunately only a very limited
number of donations has been received from the large number of users that rely on SoftechSoftware products for their applications.
Producing and updating good software costs time. So it costs money. Also, maintaning a dedicated web site
costs time and money.

Starting from now on almost all SoftechSoftware products will be distributed into a single general use DLL. This DLL
will show an annoying dialog each time your application starts. Also, this demo DLL has resource and memory leaks that make
your target application unstable. You can use the demo DLL only for testing the SoftechSoftware product you are interested in.
Then if you decide to use this product into your application you must buy the full DLL version directly from SoftechSoftware.

SoftechSoftware DLL costs $100.00 (One hundred U.S. Dollars).
